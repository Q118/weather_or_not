# Weather or Not

An Open Weather Map API

![](https://github.com/Q118/weather_or_not/blob/master/Assets/screenshot-weather.png)

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. My objective in this app is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

## Installation

Use the [OpenWeather API]() to retrieve weather data for cities.
Open the app in your browser, search for your city of choice. Repeat as often as you like. The app stores your cities so you can return to them later.
