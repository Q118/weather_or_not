# Weather Dashboard

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

first load:
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
    display search and text input

## use local storage

/when the page loads
    get cities from local storafe
    if there are any
    update global cities
    render search history


/when the user clicks search button
    add search to the history
    save cities in local storage
    render search history


RENDER search history
clear all the cities
loop through global cities array
create city button for each city


CITIESLIST = [];

FUNCXTION LIKE IN THE 4.28 TODO LIST
ITS STORING AN ARRAY
got to parse it

havbe a global cities array thats blank 
like the todos in 4.28
if not null then
todos= storedTodos
storedtodos inside 
literally do it like that activity
